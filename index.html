<h2>Hello!</h2>

<p>I am currently a senior undergraduate at the University of Minnesota and I am set to graduate in the spring of 2020.I have an interest in learning Japanese and about Japan in my free time. My goal is to one day work for a company that has ties to Japan. </p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<li><strong>University of Minnesota</strong></li>
<p>B.S. Technical Writing and Communication with a subplan in IT and Design.</p>

<p>My course work focused on creating clear and concise documents, exploring the use of rhetoric, learning about design, beginning coding, project management, and communication. </p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>Other than technical writing, I am interested in doing creative writing, such as fiction novels and poems. I have three animals, a horse, cat, and a dog. My horse is a buckskin tobiano named Mavis (mare); my cat is a vocal lilac-point siamese named Mikki (Me-key) (female); and my dog is mutt with a golden coat named Marvel (female). I enjoy cooking, baking, reading, drawing, coloring, watching TV and playing video games.</p>
